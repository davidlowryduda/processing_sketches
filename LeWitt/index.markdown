# Sketches after LeWitt

I model many sketches after the work of Sol LeWitt. This also served as a set of
exercises to learn and develop p5js skills. I love his work, and will return to
this stuff.


## Sketches

- [Here](lewitt_11.html) is LeWitt 11
    * [Here](lewitt_11_rand.html) is LeWitt 11 with randomness and color. This
      particular sketch is glorious.
    * [Here](lewitt_11_rand_threshold.html) is Lewitt 11 with extra randomness
      and some extra color. The sensation of depth and complexity is deep.
- [Here](lewitt_16.html) is LeWitt 16, a classic formed from 3 sets of lines.
- [Here](lewitt_17.html) is LeWitt 17. Four squares, each with a fundamental
  line direction.
    * [This](unexpected_lewitt_17.html) is LeWitt 17, but with a little twist.
      After staring at many LeWitts for a day, it's like a practical joke.
    * [This](unexpected_lewitt_17_borderless.html) is LeWitt 17, but without the
      rectangular borders drawn.
- [Here](lewitt_46.html) is LeWitt 46. A canvas with many non-intersecting
  scribbles.
- [Here](lewitt_46_alive.html) is LeWitt 46, but where the scribbles slowly
  move. I find it actually quite unsettling to look closely at.
- [Here](lewitt_47.html) is LeWitt 47. The four classic patterns, without
  repeating the same pattern twice, slowly getting thicker.
- [Here](lewitt_86.html) is LeWitt 86. Many random lines on a canvas.


## Ideas

- Sketch 11 (and especially the random one with color) is super great for
  experimentation. It looks great and should be adapted to all sorts of things.
  It might be interesting to set the randomness to noise and to somehow have an
  infinite pan from the noise.
- Sketch 16 is sort of like a set of Moire patterns. Different arrangements and
  different widths would be interesting. It would also be interesting to animate
  Sketch 16. (*Do This*)
