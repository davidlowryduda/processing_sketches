# Grids

This page collects sketches around the poorly defined idea of items appearing in
rectangular grid. This is a loose arrangement, but it somehow catches the eye.
There is something about simultaneous regularity and irregularity that is
appealing.


## Sketches

- [In this sketch](pulsing_squares.html), we have a warmup activity of some
  squares in motion.
