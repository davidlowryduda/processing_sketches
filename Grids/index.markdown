# Grids

This page collects sketches around the poorly defined idea of items appearing in
rectangular grid. This is a loose arrangement, but it somehow catches the eye.
There is something about simultaneous regularity and irregularity that is
appealing.


## Sketches

- [In this sketch](pulsing_squares.html), we have a warmup activity of some
  squares in motion.
- We next begin a series of studies centered around grids of squares.
    * In [this sketch](small_square_grid.html), we have a small grid of squares.
    * In [this sketch](small_square_grid_missing.html), we make it slightly more
      visually interesting by removing some squares.
    * By deforming the squares, we get [this sketch](small_deform_grid_missing.html).
    * Taking the deformations to an extreme, we get [this sketch](small_deform_grid.html)
