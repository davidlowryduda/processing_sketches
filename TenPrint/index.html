<h1>10PRINT</h1>
<p>These sketches are based upon the classic 10PRINT pattern of long ago. The idea
is simple: randomly create either a "\" or a "/", and marvel at the pleasant
maze-like image that results.</p>
<h2>Created sketches</h2>
<p>We make the following sketches.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="10print.html">this page</a>, we have the simplest form, 10PRINT in its raw
form.</li>
<li><a href="10print_horizontal.html">Here</a>, we change the probability horizontally. It's
more visually appealing.</li>
<li><a href="10print_iterative.html">This</a>, we produce the image iteratively.</li>
<li><a href="10print_threshold.html">Here</a>, the probability changes horizontally, but in a
random fashion. It may be necessary to refresh multiple times to get a
visually appealing image --- the extra randomness is a bit hard to predict.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ideas for additional sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep a data structure and fill in created boxes of a color, maybe.</li>
<li>Apply a color to some rectangle surrounding the implied square. I wonder if it
would look appealing? Perhaps color the a 3x3 region with some alpha?</li>
<li>Add a few other shapes. Perhaps part-circles.</li>
<li>Add color.</li>
</ul>
