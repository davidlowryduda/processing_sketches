TITLE: 10 Print Sketches

# 10PRINT

These sketches are based upon the classic 10PRINT pattern of long ago. The idea
is simple: randomly create either a "\" or a "/", and marvel at the pleasant
maze-like image that results.


## Created sketches

We make the following sketches.

- In [this page](10print.html), we have the simplest form, 10PRINT in its raw
  form.
- [Here](10print_horizontal.html), we change the probability horizontally. It's
  more visually appealing.
- [This](10print_iterative.html), we produce the image iteratively.
- [Here](10print_threshold.html), the probability changes horizontally, but in a
  random fashion. It may be necessary to refresh multiple times to get a
  visually appealing image --- the extra randomness is a bit hard to predict.


## Ideas for additional sketches

- Keep a data structure and fill in created boxes of a color, maybe.
- Apply a color to some rectangle surrounding the implied square. I wonder if it
  would look appealing? Perhaps color the a 3x3 region with some alpha?
- Add a few other shapes. Perhaps part-circles.
- Add color.
