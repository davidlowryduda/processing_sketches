# p5js drawing experiments

Here I document some drawing experiments with p5js.

## LeWitt Studies

On [this page](LeWitt/), I have been studying LeWitt's work. Often I add motion
or color.


## 10PRINT

On [this page](TenPrint/), I have some studies revolving around the old 10PRINT
program.


## Blobby Surfaces

[Here](FirstSurfaces/), I began to experiment with making apparently 3d objects
in 2d space.


## Red Rectangles

[Here](RedRectangles/), I draw red rectangles. This is substantially more
complicated than the rest of the logic.


## Tangents

[This page](Tangents/) has tangent envelopes to curves.


## Grids

[This page](Grids/) has things occurring roughly in grids.


## Mathy stuff

[This page](Mathy/) is for heavily math-inspired things.


## CWD

[CWD](Current/) for current experiments.
