<h1>Stippling</h1>
<p>We begin a set of sketches based around a technique of stippling. This technique
is noise-based and computationally very fast --- but I now see it has the
downside of not giving beautifully uniform stippling. Thus this is something to
return to should I ever decide to implement a better stippling algorithm.
(The naive one where one looks at lots and lots of points and checks that none
are too near might even be just fine for not-too-many-points).</p>
<h2>Sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="basic_stippling.html">this sketch</a>, we have some basic stippling.</li>
<li>Compare that to <a href="random_dots.html">this sketch</a>, which has randomness instead
  of uniformity.</li>
<li><a href="stipple_class.html">This sketch</a> is actually a test of a stipple rectangle
  class I wrote.</li>
<li><a href="stipple_stripes.html">This sketch</a> uses that class to produce a set of
  stripes. Note that for higher density, it's not-quite uniform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p><a href="stipple_art.html">Art</a> is supposed to hold some additional markings, like a set
of cubic curves or something. The cubic interpolator class was written for this.</p>
