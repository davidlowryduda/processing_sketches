# Heavily math inspired art

Here, we document overwhelmingly math-inspired art.


## Sketches

- In [this first sketch](zeta_basic.html), we draw the zeta function. It's
  interactive. The mouse gives a  point (x, y), and the first 100 terms of the
  zeta function at $x + iy$ are plotted, each getting their own color. Note that
  this is a description of the actual sum, not the analytic continuation.

  In the future, this wants to be given a color scheme like in 3b1b's video and
  sent to him (after various improvements).
