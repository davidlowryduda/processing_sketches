<h1>Envelope Sketches</h1>
<p>In this study, we sketch many tangent lines to curves.</p>
<h2>Sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="sine_envelope.html">this simple sketch</a>, we plot the sine curve and many
  of its tangents. This shows just how simple it is to make something that looks
  absolutely glorious.</li>
<li><a href="sine_envelope_motion.html">The next sketch</a> is a variation in which the
  number of points at which tangents are drawn varies and slowly oscillates.
  Although the number of points slowly changes, the overall impact is furious
  activity.</li>
<li>We change the underlying function to be a product of a sine and an exponential
  in <a href="exp_sine_curve.html">this sketch</a></li>
<li>And <a href="random_curve.html">here</a>, we alter the exponential and sine factors in a
  random way. It may take a few refreshes to get something interesting.</li>
<li>Adding noise and rythm yields <a href="random_curve_noise.html">this sketch</a>, which I
  find rather entrancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I would like to do the same thing for a different set of random functions. It
would be nice to perhaps generate something like a noise-defined degree 8
polynomial fit and do it with that, or something. Maybe.</p>
<p>There is a whole worls of color to play with. And consider making noise defined
functions that allow one to have an infinite scrolling-effect, which might be
super cool.</p>
