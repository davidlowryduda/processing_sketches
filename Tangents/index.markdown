# Envelope Sketches

In this study, we sketch many tangent lines to curves.


## Sketches

- In [this simple sketch](sine_envelope.html), we plot the sine curve and many
  of its tangents. This shows just how simple it is to make something that looks
  absolutely glorious.
- [The next sketch](sine_envelope_motion.html) is a variation in which the
  number of points at which tangents are drawn varies and slowly oscillates.
  Although the number of points slowly changes, the overall impact is furious
  activity.
- We change the underlying function to be a product of a sine and an exponential
  in [this sketch](exp_sine_curve.html)
- And [here](random_curve.html), we alter the exponential and sine factors in a
  random way. It may take a few refreshes to get something interesting.
- Adding noise and rythm yields [this sketch](random_curve_noise.html), which I
  find rather entrancing.
- Going in a different direction: in [this
  sketch](sine_by_parabolas_envelope.html) we plot the sine and many of its
  quadratic approximators. Also glorious.


## Thoughts

I would like to do the same thing for a different set of random functions. It
would be nice to perhaps generate something like a noise-defined degree 8
polynomial fit and do it with that, or something. Maybe.

There is a whole worls of color to play with. And consider making noise defined
functions that allow one to have an infinite scrolling-effect, which might be
super cool.
