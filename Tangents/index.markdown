# Envelope Sketches

In this study, we sketch many tangent lines to curves.


## Sketches

- In [this simple sketch](sine_envelope.html), we plot the sine curve and many
  of its tangents. This shows just how simple it is to make something that looks
  absolutely glorious.
- [The next sketch](sine_envelope_motion.html) is a variation in which the
  number of points at which tangents are drawn varies and slowly oscillates.
  Although the number of points slowly changes, the overall impact is furious
  activity.
- We change the underlying function to be a product of a sine and an exponential
  in [this sketch](exp_sine_curve.html)
- And [here](random_curve.html), we alter the exponential and sine factors in a
  random way. It may take a few refreshes to get something interesting.
