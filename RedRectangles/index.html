<h1>Red Rectangles</h1>
<p>I draw inspiration from Malevich's "8 Red Rectangles", and appropriately draw
several red rectangles.</p>
<h2>Sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="red_rectangles.html">Here</a>, I do a first approximation. There are several
  things I like here. This is the first javascript class I've ever written. The
  logic is actually a bit complicated, but rather nice.</li>
<li><a href="red_rectangles_large.html">Here</a>, I have additional logic that makes the
  rectangles generically larger.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I have implemented within this logic for drawing several rectangles randomly
that do not intersect each other. That's nice.</p>
<p>The logic for filling the available area is non-trivial in principle --- I did a
poor approximation. So my rectangles will never fill the corners of the image. I
should take a moment and really try to understand where the actual boundaries
are, and do a better job of placing rectangles within the entire canvas.</p>
